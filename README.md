# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marina and I am a Junior Frontend Developer. I feel confortable using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. I am a lifelong learner, I try to stay focused on my goals and I love teamworking since it challenges myself to become a better developer. I have some knowledge of AWS, postman, Angular, Node.js, Python, C and Java.

## Experience

Since september 2022 I am studying a higher level vocational training in Multi-platform Applications Development at [Campanillas High School](https://fp.iescampanillas.com/).

Inside the 42 Network students are very proactive and engaged with a strong community and peer-to-peer curriculum. The education model focuses on project-based learning and teamwork, which is an outstanding methodology to develop both hard and soft skills.

In July 2022 I finished the "C Piscine", a 26-day on-site pre-selection period where candidates, not yet students, complete individual projects, pass exams and improve teamwork skills. After that, I was selected to continue at 42 as a student. 

#### Hard skills
* __C Language__: it is the first language that we learn at 42.  dealing with variables, pointers, memory allocation, creating functions and programs, including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

* __Shell__: we learn basic to intermediate shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

* __Git__: all projects are submitted to a remote git repository, so students need to be familiar with this system.

#### Soft skills 
* __Self-learning and proactiveness__: at 42 we have to learn helping each others, searching in Google, trying and acquiring knowledge through trial and error. 

* __Teamwork and communication__: the whole system is based on peer-to-peer learning. Also, from time to time we have to collaborate in groups randomly	chosen by the school's system to develop a fully running application.

* __Time management and productivity__: during the Piscine, we work for 26 days in a fast-paced environment. Also, the school is open 24/7 for us. In order to deal with this and deliver our projects without "drowning", we need to develop excellent time management skills and to be productive.
