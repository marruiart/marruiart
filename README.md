# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior full-stack programmer with experience in several programming languages and technologies. I have developed projects using JavaScript, Java, PHP, and C, I have worked as well with both SQL and non-relational databases such as MongoDB. In addition to my programming skills, I also have experience in web design using HTML and CSS, in addition to creating websites with WordPress. I have also used virtualization tools such as Docker, Virtualbox, AWS, and VMWare. I have used frameworks such as Angular, Lumen, among other tools like Postman, JSP, Bootstrap, Material.io, Figma, etc.

I am a passionate longlife learner and I am always looking to improve my programming and design skills. As a result, I have taken various courses in digital marketing, Python, Git/GitHub, testing, and other related fields. I love teamworking and I am a very collaborative person, always willing to share knowledge and learn from others. These interests led me to enroll at 42 MÃ¡laga, where I am currently a student.

Inside the 42 Network students are very proactive and engaged with a strong community and peer-to-peer curriculum. The education model focuses on project-based learning and teamwork, which is an outstanding methodology to develop both hard and soft skills.

[![mruiz-ar's 42 stats](https://badge.mediaplus.ma/black/mruiz-ar)](https://github.com/oakoudad/badge42)

In July 2022 I finished the "C Piscine", a 26-day on-site pre-selection period where candidates, not yet students, complete individual projects, pass exams and improve teamwork skills. After that, I was selected to continue at 42 as a student. 

#### Hard skills developed in 42
* __C Language__: it is the first language that we learn at 42.  dealing with variables, pointers, memory allocation, creating functions and programs, including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

* __Shell__: we learn basic to intermediate shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

* __Git__: all projects are submitted to a remote git repository, so students need to be familiar with this system.

#### Soft skills improved in 42
* __Self-learning and proactiveness__: at 42 we have to learn helping each others, searching in Google, trying and acquiring knowledge through trial and error. 

* __Teamwork and communication__: the whole system is based on peer-to-peer learning. Also, from time to time we have to collaborate in groups randomly	chosen by the school's system to develop a fully running application.

* __Time management and productivity__: during the Piscine, we work for 26 days in a fast-paced environment. Also, the school is open 24/7 for us. In order to deal with this and deliver our projects without "drowning", we need to develop excellent time management skills and to be productive.
