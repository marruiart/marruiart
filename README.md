# Hi there 👋

I work as a developer at a Málaga-based startup where we use cutting-edge technologies built on AWS infrastructure (Lambdas in Python, DynamoDB, API Gateway, among others) and develop cross-platform applications using Angular. While I primarily work with Python and TypeScript/JavaScript, I'm also comfortable programming in languages like Java, Kotlin, PHP, and SQL. I also have strong skills in web design with HTML and CSS. In addition, I have knowledge of C language and experience with technologies such as Android, React, and Laravel.

If you find my profile interesting, please feel free to check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/marruiart?tab=repositories) or visit my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/marruiart) profile.

## Experience

### [Multi-platform Applications Development](https://www.todofp.es/dam/jcr:7655e32d-08a3-47a7-a479-ddb6f032c63e/n-tsdesarrolloaplicacionesmultiplataformaen-pdf.pdf)
Since september 2022 I am studying a higher level vocational training in Multi-platform Applications Development at [Campanillas High School](https://fp.iescampanillas.com/). 

With this studies, I will acquire the General Competence with regard to developing, installing, documenting and maintaining multi-platform computer applications, using technologies and specific development environments, guaranteeing secure access to data and complying with «usability» and quality criteria required by established standards.

### [Professional Certificate Level 3 in Development of Applications with Web Technologies](https://www.todofp.es/dam/todofp/certificados-profesionalidad/europass/n3-ifcd0210-in-pub.pdf)
En noviembre de 2022 finalicé el CDP de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones con Tecnologías Web en el [CIPFP Campanillas PTA](https://fp.iescampanillas.com/).

### [Student at 42 Malaga](https://www.42malaga.com/)

Inside the 42 Network students are very proactive and engaged with a strong community and peer-to-peer curriculum. The education model focuses on project-based learning and teamwork, which is an outstanding methodology to develop both hard and soft skills.

[![mruiz-ar's 42 stats](https://badge.mediaplus.ma/black/mruiz-ar)](https://github.com/oakoudad/badge42)

In July 2022 I finished the "C Piscine", a 26-day on-site pre-selection period where candidates, not yet students, complete individual projects, pass exams and improve teamwork skills. After that, I was selected to continue at 42 as a student. 

#### Hard skills developed in 42
* __C Language__: it is the first language that we learn at 42.  dealing with variables, pointers, memory allocation, creating functions and programs, including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

* __Shell__: we learn basic to intermediate shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

* __Git__: all projects are submitted to a remote git repository, so students need to be familiar with this system.

#### Soft skills improved in 42
* __Self-learning and proactiveness__: at 42 we have to learn helping each others, searching in Google, trying and acquiring knowledge through trial and error. 

* __Teamwork and communication__: the whole system is based on peer-to-peer learning. Also, from time to time we have to collaborate in groups randomly	chosen by the school's system to develop a fully running application.

* __Time management and productivity__: during the Piscine, we work for 26 days in a fast-paced environment. Also, the school is open 24/7 for us. In order to deal with this and deliver our projects without "drowning", we need to develop excellent time management skills and to be productive.
